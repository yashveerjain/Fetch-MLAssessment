# Base Model
Base Model Architecture:
 - Embedding Layer
 - Positional Encoding
 - Transformer Encoder Layer

This is the base model which is used for all the tasks. Used Transformer Encoder Layer for all the tasks. Reason for this is using attention between words give better understanding of the sentence, resulting in good embeddings.

## Task1
Sentence Embedding Transformer Model, architecture:
 - Base Model
 - Mean Pooling
 - Linear Layer (300 dimension)

## Task2
Sentiment Classification Model, architecture:
 - Base Model
 - Mean Pooling
 - Linear Layer (3 classes, Positive, Negative, Neutral)
